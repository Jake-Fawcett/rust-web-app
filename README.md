# rust-web-server

Simple dockerized rust webapp, pushed to Github Container Registry with Github actions. This has been extended to deploy to an Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Instance with Terraform.

This has been decommissioned as it was initially done to learn Rust, but wasn't effective for learning Rust, or build due to long compile times. This has been since modified to use Github Pages and Jekyll (Ruby).
